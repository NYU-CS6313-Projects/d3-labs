    - better-scales.js had d3.extent misspelled as d3.extent*s*. This has been corrected
    - The original better-scales.js was missing a few parenthesis to close function blocks. This is now fixed
    - An additional file, scatter-dynamicscales.html is now available, showing how to use the dynamic scales
